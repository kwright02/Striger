Above, you will notice that there are different 'sections' that highly resemble JSON syntax, and you wouldn't be entirely wrong. Striger is based on JSON syntax to allow for easy comprehension, and to provide a sense of familiarity. Striger's syntax reuires you to group objects in patterns which not only highly optimizes the system, but gives it a modern feel new languages like Striger need to thrive.
